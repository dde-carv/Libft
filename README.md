# Libft

Libft is the first project from the 42 Common Core curriculum. The objective of this project is to reproduce the functionality of various standard C library functions. Through this project, students learn the basics and fundamentals of programming in C. Additionally, the bonus part of this project covers linked lists and how they work.

## Introduction

This project is aimed at creating a custom library of standard C functions. It serves as a foundation for further projects in the 42 Common Core curriculum, helping students to understand and master essential programming concepts.

## Functions

The library includes implementations of several standard C functions. Some examples are:

- `ft_memset`
- `ft_bzero`
- `ft_memcpy`
- `ft_memmove`
- `ft_memchr`
- `ft_memcmp`
- `ft_strlen`
- `ft_strlcpy`
- `ft_strlcat`
- `ft_strchr`
- `ft_strrchr`
- `ft_strnstr`
- `ft_strncmp`
- `ft_atoi`
- `ft_isalpha`
- `ft_isdigit`
- `ft_isalnum`
- `ft_isascii`
- `ft_isprint`
- `ft_toupper`
- `ft_tolower`

...and many more.

## Bonus

The bonus part of this project includes additional functions to handle linked lists. These functions help in understanding how linked lists work and how to manipulate them. Some examples are:

- `ft_lstadd_back`
- `ft_lstadd_front`
- `ft_lstclear`
- `ft_lstdelone`
- `ft_lstiter`
- `ft_lstlast`
- `ft_lstmap`
- `ft_lstnew`
- `ft_lstsize`
